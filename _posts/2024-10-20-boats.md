I think one of the things I struggle with in photography is how to deal with a beautiful blue sky. I just can't stand to leave it there. Instead I'm compelled to desaturate it or obscure it somehow.

Here I opted to wash out the whole image and restrict it to black and white, so the saturated sky disappears. You still get the feeling of a sunny day, but it doesn't look like a cartoon, which fits in more with the mood of the photo.
