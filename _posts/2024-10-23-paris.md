On this trip I haven't brought a computer to edit photos from my a6500 on (ok I've got my iPad but that's a [whole other thing](https://willhbr.net/2019/11/02/impracticalities-of-ios-photo-management-for-photographers/)) which has led me to spend a bunch more time editing my phone photos.

Through a combination of copy/pasting adjustments between similar photos, and saving some presets, I can quickly and consistently get pretty good results.

These ones aren't actually too heavily reliant on presets, but are the starting point of the style I settled on. It's basically just some exposure adjustments (raising the shadows), boosting the clarity and texture, accentuating the colour and brightness of the walls, and adding a mild vignette.

The overcast weather meant there wasn't a lot of room for playing with the light, but I think this really helped the phone capture the scene better. Without a lot of dynamic range—everything is pretty washed out—you're free to add contrast back in yourself later.
