The other trick with these overcast photos is to use the automatic sky selection in Photomator to create a second set of adjustments and add more texture and clarity to the clouds, as well as dropping the exposure slightly. This gives you a much more distinctive sky, without turning the rest of the photo into an over-contrasted mess.

I've been pleasantly surprised about how good the ML sky detection is, I'm always worried that I'll end up with a garish border. Not sure if this is just because I'm taking pictures of buildings with well-defined edges, or because I'm just looking at these on a little phone screen.
