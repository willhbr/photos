I was lucky enough to be able to take my camera up in a helicopter around Sydney, and accidentally took this really nice pair of photos. The camera started tracking focus of the rain on the windscreen and I happened to snap an out-of-focus opera house in the background, with some nice colour in the harbour.

Both taken with a polarising filter to cut down on reflections and get more vivid colour in the water.
