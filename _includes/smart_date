This allows me to not bother putting times on posts, but still have a
semi-accurate initial publish time in feeds. The time will be the latest site
build time if it's on the same day as the post publish date, otherwise it'll be
the normal publish date (at midnight).

{%- assign page_date = date | date: '%F' -%}
{%- assign site_date = site.time | date: '%F' -%}
{%- if page_date == site_date -%}
  {{ site.time | date: include.format }}
{%- else -%}
  {{ date | date: include.format }}
{%- endif -%}
