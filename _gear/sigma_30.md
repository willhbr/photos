Only taken out when the f1.4 aperture is necessary. Not the biggest fan of this focal length, I find it's not quite wide enough to capture a whole scene, but also not telephoto enough to get a detail shot, or to get a lot of compression. I think that I'm basically just not really into mid-range focal lengths.
